Project: Capstone Proposal and Capstone Project 

Welcome to the Udacity Dog Breed Classification project! In this project I have developed and tested an algorithm which will classify the breed of a dog upon inputting an image. 

The capstone project has two stages- the first stage involves the proposal wherein you have to state the domain backgroun, problem statement, datasets and input, solution metrics, benchmark model and the project design (i.e- steps to be taken to complete the project)

The second stage of the project involves the implementation of the capstone project and developing a project report discussing the developent stage of the project.
